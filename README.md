**For playing around with TYPO3 BE UX**

## System requirements

- TYPO3 12

## What is it?
**Thsi extension is not meant to provide real life functionality right now.**
But to test and try some simple concepts for TYPO3 BE user experience. It's a dirty hack :D
- getting rid of Layout vs Language mode in page module
- cleaned up interface for less buttons doing the same thing
- etc...
